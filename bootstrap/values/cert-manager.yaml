# Helm values for the cert-manager chart.
# Reference: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager

# The CRDs must be applied manually before installing the chart, as Helm and Argo CD do not handle CRD installation automatically.
# Run this command before the Argo CD application syncs:
# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.17.2/cert-manager.crds.yaml
